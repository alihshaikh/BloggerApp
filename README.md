# BloggerApp

A Social Media-esque application that allows users to create their own profiles are post blogs. 

Application uses the MERN stack -- MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js

Reflection: Although using many resources to help compile this project together such as youtube, this project helped me learn A LOT. Before this, I would simply create static web apps that did not rely on any server or database. But finally integrating front-end ideas with a backend was super cool to see.
